# Data-Center-Load-Fault-Tolerance-Simulation
The repository for my CS4632 Modeling and Simulation Project

Project Overview

Project Title:
Intelligent Data Center Load \& Fault-Tolerance Simulation

Domain:
Network Systems / Cloud Computing / Distributed Systems

Problem Statement:
Modern cloud data centers must handle unpredictable user traffic while maintaining high availability despite server failures. My project seeks to answer the following questions
    How do different load balancing algorithms affect system response time and throughput?
    How resilient is the system under random server failures?
    Which routing strategies minimize congestion and request lost under peak load conditions?


Scope:
Included:
        Simulation of client requests, server nodes, and a load balancer
        Stochastic arrival and service times
        Multiple load balancing strategies
        Random server failures and recovery
        Data collection and performance analysis
        
Not Included:
        Real network packet-level simulation
        Real cloud APIs
        Machine learning model training
        item Physical hardware modeling
