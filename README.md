The repository for my CS4632 Modeling and Simulation Project

\section{Project Overview}

\subsection{Project Title:} 
Intelligent Data Center Load \& Fault-Tolerance Simulation

\subsection{Domain:} 
Network Systems / Cloud Computing / Distributed Systems

\subsection{Problem Statement:} 
Modern cloud data centers must handle unpredictable user traffic while maintaining high availability despite server failures. My project seeks to answer the following questions
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do different load balancing algorithms affect system response time and throughput?
    \item How resilient is the system under random server failures?
    \item Which routing strategies minimize congestion and request lost under peak load conditions?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope:}
\textbf{Included:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation of client requests, server nodes, and a load balancer
    \item Stochastic arrival and service times
    \item Multiple load balancing strategies
    \item Random server failures and recovery
    \item Data collection and performance analysis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Not Included:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real network packet-level simulation
    \item Real cloud APIs
    \item Machine learning model training
    \item Physical hardware modeling
\end{itemize}
